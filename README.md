<br>- Great challenge!
<br>- Written in JS and can be executed with Node.
<br>- Only 2.task of each day here (because it's pretty much the "extended" version of the 1.task - and also only output was needed).
<br>- Day 11 I took a "short" break and till today I haven't...
<br>- Enjoy my silly codes haha ;)
